# TEXUS 2019 Events Page - National Level Technical Fest 

Texus, a collabortion born out of imagination, rooted in pragmatic realisation and inspired by an indomitable, undaunted aura of inspiration. It is a celebration where the creative brilliance of imagination is given freedom not to reach for the stars, but to touch the "perceived horizon" persisting an inch higher. It is a National Level Tech Fest organised by Department of Computer Science and Engineering, SRM Institute of Science and Technology, Ramapuram. As many as 50 events conducted with the purpose of celebrating all that the human soul wants to celebrate and think all that the human brain wants to think, ranging from 24 Hour Hackathons for the geeks to Open Mic events are a part of this conglomeration of Creative arts.
